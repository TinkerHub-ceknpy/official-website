          Great mentorship doesn‚Äôt come from one-way lectures. We are building a
          mentor network of practitioners ‚Äî people who code, design, make, and
          teach alongside learners. These are professionals and peers who are
          willing to listen, share real stories, and help debug both projects
          and thought processes.

          We have been using the term 'maker' for a long time at TinkerHub. By
          'maker', we refer to TinkerHub volunteers and members who possess a
          unique blend of creativity, problem-solving abilities, commitment to
          continuous learning and wants to be part of TinkerHub movement to make
          a change.
          <br /><br />
          üßë‚Äçüîß Makers are the innovators and creators who utilize their diverse
          skills and knowledge across various disciplines to build, create, and
          improve the world around them.
          <br /><br />
          Makers take an interdisciplinary approach, combining skills to achieve
          their goals. We believe anyone can be a maker ‚Äì it's about the
          mindset, passion for learning, and drive to create & innovate. By
          nurturing these qualities, we aim to empower the next generation of
          makers to build a better future for themselves and the world around
          them.
          <br /><br />
          In TinkerHub context, we primarily focus on building with the help of
          technology and its adjacents. Given the same, we are not limited to
          coding.
