## Why Campus Communities?

The perfect combination (after *pazhampori and beef roast* 😋) is — *Community and Tinkering*.  

Think about those moments when you were fascinated by how things work around you:  
- Why do fast chargers really charge fast ⚡?  
- Why doesn’t the seatbelt alarm ring until someone sits there? 🚗  
- Why do line followers move only through black… oh wait, can it move through other colors too? 👀  
- How do planes fly ✈ and bulbs glow 💡?  

Makers who designed the things we use every day were once just curious chaps, asking questions and experimenting their way to innovation.  

But here’s the deal — you don’t have to figure everything out alone.  
When you’re surrounded by other curious minds, magic happens.  
That’s what a *Campus Community* is all about. 💫

## 🧩 Foundational Skills

In collaboration with industry experts, community members, and thought leaders,  
we identified the *skills that future makers need* — and we call them *Foundational Skills*.  

These aren’t just technical skills. They’re everything that makes you a builder, a thinker, and a doer.
