## 🌈 Why Us?

The perfect combination (after _pazhampori and beef roast_ 😋) is — _Community and Tinkering_.

Think about those moments when you were fascinated by how things work around you:

- Why do fast chargers really charge fast ⚡?
- Why doesn’t the seatbelt alarm ring until someone sits there? 🚗
- Why do line followers move only through black… oh wait, can it move through other colors too? 👀
- How do planes fly ✈ and bulbs glow 💡?

> Makers who designed the things we use every day were once just curious chaps, asking questions and experimenting their way to innovation.

But here’s the deal — you don’t have to figure everything out alone.  
When you’re surrounded by other curious minds, magic happens.  
That’s what a _Campus Community_ is all about. 💫

In collaboration with industry experts, community members, and thought leaders,  
we identified the _skills that future makers need_ — and we call them _Foundational Skills_.
